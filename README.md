- Read: Read a word from the keyboard into a specific location in memory.

- Write: Write a word from a specific location in memory to the screen.
- Load: Load a word from a specific location in memory into the accumulator.
- Store: Store a word from the accumulator into a specific location in memory.
- Add: Add a word from a specific location in memory to the word in the accumulator (leave the result in the accumulator).
- Subtract: Subtract a word from a specific location in memory from the word in the accumulator (leave the result in the accumulator).
- Divide: Divide a word from a specific location in memory into the word in the accumulator (leave the result in the accumulator).
- Multiply: Multiply a word from a specific location in memory by the word in the accumulator (leave the result in the accumulator).
- Branch: Branch to a specific location in memory.
- BranchNeg: Branch to a specific location in memory if the accumulator is negative.
- BranchZero: Branch to a specific location in memory if the accumulator is zero.
- Halt: Halt the program.
- Memory dump: Display the contents of the memory.
